# Upskilling-Java Inheritance and Polimorphism

## Inheritance

In Java is possible inhertance the atributes and methods from one class to another. This are group in two categories:

- Subclass
The class inheritance from another.

- Superclass
The class where inheritance from .

## Polimorphism

Is one of the pillars of OOP and describes the situations in something that can happend in many ways.
There are two differnt types of polimorphism:

### Estatic 
Java allows to implement multiple methods in the same class with the same name. The methods must differ in at least one of the following criteria:

- Have a different quantity of arguments.
- The Type of the arguments is different.
- The excepcted arguments are in different order (not recommended).
-
### Dynamic
In this way Polymorphism does not allow the compiler to determine the method that will be executed. The JVM determines the execution time.
Always in the context of Inheritance, a subclass can override a method of its parent class (superclass), allowing you to customize or replace its behavior entirely.
